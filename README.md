# newproject
new project, with official algorithms and better config structures.

build my own object detection framework, borrowed some code and structure from some other open source framework/algorithms, including meta detectron, mmlab mmdetection, hrnet, etc. 

the algorithms are borrowed directly from the official websites, to make sure it achieves the best result.
